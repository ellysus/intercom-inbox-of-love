# Intro

The Inbox of love is a small heart Icon at the bottom of the old Inbox screen that displays recent positive ratings along with some confetti, pretty cool right?

After Intercom released their new version of the Inbox, the "Inbox of Love" feature hasn't made it to the new version. This chrome extension brings it back!
